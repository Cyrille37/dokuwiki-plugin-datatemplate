## Development status
Let me start by saying that the plugin seems to work well at the time of this writing (Jan 2014). Unfortunately,
I have for a while now not had the time to actively continue development of this plugin. This means that any feature
request are likely to be ignored. Sorry. Reasonable pull requests, however, are likely to be accepted.
